# TODO Lister

A plugin for Obsidian to manage all of your "TODOs."

When I'm using Obsidian to write, I typically make notes prefixed or ending with "TODO" to remind myself what I need to return to. Sometimes, it's hard to remember where those were, and to return to them.

TODO Lister will search all of your markdown files for any lines that contain "TODO: ..." or end with "TODO," and then build a list of those notes grouped by file.
